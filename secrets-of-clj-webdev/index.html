And when you updated A1 or B1, C1 updated? Hoplon cells work just like this, but instead of referencing them by letter and number, they are referenced like any other Clojure value. They are a Clojure reference type like atoms and the same functions work on them, but they automatically propogate updates from input cells to formula cells.</aside></section><section><h2 class="title">Hoplon cell example</h2><pre><code>(def state       (cell []))
(def completed   (cell= (filter :completed state)))
(def active      (cell= (remove :completed state)))
(def plural-item (cell= (pluralize "item" (count active))))

;; Later in the page
(span :id "todo-count"
      (strong (text "~(count active) "))
      (span (text " ~{plural-item} left")))</code></pre><aside class="notes">You can see in the first four lines here how we set up an input cell and three formula cells. When the value in state is changed, the three formula cells are automatically updated. The string interpolation below binds these text nodes to the values of the formula cells. The change is propogated into the text cells.</aside></section><section><h2 class="title">Hoplon and the DOM</h2><div>Hoplon uses the DOM for input and output. Examples:</div><ul><li>on-click</li><li>on-change</li></ul><ul><li>do-value</li><li>do-class</li></ul><aside class="notes">Hoplon uses the DOM for input and output. All user input is done through DOM events like on-click and on-change. Code is attached to these events, like you're used to from jQuery or other libraries. Output is done by manipulating the properties of DOM nodes using special do- attributes. The value of these attributes is always a formula cell.</aside></section><section><h2 class="title">Hoplon DOM example</h2><pre><code>(input
 :id "new-todo"
 :type "text"
 :do-focus loaded?
 :do-attr (cell= {:placeholder (if loaded?
                                 "What needs to be done?"
                                 "Loading...")}) 
 :on-focusout #(do! (by-id :new-todo) :value ""))</code></pre><aside class="notes">You can see in this input element an example of do- and on- parameters. Starting with :do-focus, you can see that it's looking at the value of the loaded? cell. If the loaded? cell contains true, then focus on this input. This means that this input will gain focus when loaded? becomes true. :do-attr sets the placeholder attribute on this input based on the current loading state. It uses an anonymous cell so that this will update. We didn't have to use an anonymous cell with :do-focus because loaded? is a cell. Lastly, look at :on-focusout. The do! multimethod allows us to programmatically do the same thing we do with the do- attributes: update a DOM element.</aside></section><section><h2>Full example of Hoplon</h2><a shape="rect" href="https://github.com/cndreisbach/codemash-2014-presentation/blob/master/todo-hoplon/src/index.cljs.hl" target="_blank">Code on GitHub</a></section><section><h2>Hoplon compiles to static files</h2><ul><li>They can be used anywhere</li><li>And with any backend</li></ul></section></section><section><section><h1>Liberator</h1></section><section><h2>REST APIs with Liberator</h2><ul><li>Liberator provides resources</li><li>Resources are decision trees</li><li>Resources provide a REST interface</li><li>Resources are Ring handlers</li></ul><aside class="notes">Liberator implements RFC 2616, the HTTP 1.1 spec.

The context has the request in it, as well as the response. In this resource, we look to see if the language parameter is equal to 'en' or 'es' and if so, then handle-ok is called. If not, handle-not-found is called. We did not have to define handle-ok and handle-not-found: Liberator provides default functions for all decisions and handlers. There's repeated code here, though, to look up the language, and I probably should have looked it up a third time in :handle-not-found. Let's see how we can fix that.</aside></section><section><h2>Liberator context</h2><pre><code>(require '[liberator.core :refer [defresource]])

Any time we return a map, it is merged into the context map and available elsewhere. We could have even used destructuring to pull lang out, but I didn't want to confuse the issue. That's more idiomatic of my usage, though. It looks like we can't get lang so easily in handle-not-found, but Liberator does provide a way.</aside></section><section><h2>Liberator context on decision failure</h2><pre><code>(require '[liberator.core :refer [defresource]])

I didn't mention actions before, but they are what they look like: functions for dealing with requests that do not use the GET method, and which likely have side-effects. These do continue on to handlers. For example, post! checks a decision function, new?, after it completes successfully.

Liberator has a lot of logic around this and does not treat maps as Ring responses. Depending on the content-type, your map might be rendered as an HTML table, a CSV, or transformed into JSON or XML. If you have a map you have created as a Ring response, make sure to use liberator.representation/ring-response to designate it as a response.
